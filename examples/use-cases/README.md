# Example Use Cases
Included with the Automox Console SDK is a group of common use case scripts that can either be used out of the box or 
as a basis for modification in order to facilitate real world solutions. These scripts are provided "As Is"; however, 
customers are encouraged to make changes as necessary to fit their environment or process needs. If a modification can
be generally applied and useful to a variety of environments, [contributions](https://github.com/AutomoxCommunity/automox-console-sdk-python/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome.

- [Updating Automox Devices based on a CSV file](update_devices_by_csv)

- [Group and Tag Devices based on Active Directory](group_devices_by_activedirectory_ou)
